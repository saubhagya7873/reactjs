React cannot do routing on its own, so it needs another library to perform routing. routing specifies navigating from one page to anothe page.
  step 1: start a react application and install
  react router dom
    npm install react-router-dom
  
 step 2: create some pages as functional components manually
 step 3: routing is provided to whole application by BrowserRouter, so wrap the app components
 with BrowserRouter
 <BrowserRouter>
   <App/>
</BrowserRouter>

 step 4: Routes are provided within Routes component and Each Route will be within
 Route component . These two components are provided by react router DOM. Each Route can be specified with path and component
  
  <Routes>
      <Route path='/dashboard' element={<Dashboard />} />
      <Route path='/contact' element={<Contact />} />

  </Routes>
 step 5: anchor tag will make page reload which is not prefereble by React so , react-router-dom provides an element called Link

 step 6: child routing is possible with react router dom . we need to mention child routes
 inside the parent route

    <Routes>
      <Route path='/dashboard' element={<Dashboard />}>
         <Route path='/settings' element={<Settings/>} />
      </Route>
      <Route path='/contact' element={<Contact />} />

  </Routes>

 step 7: we can navigate to specific path by programming also using useNavigate hook.
