In React, Everything is built with components. components can be nested i.e., one component inside another component
<Comp1>
   a=20;
   <Compo2> </comp2>
</Comp1>

<Comp2>
     <Comp3></Comp3>
</Comp2>

<Comp3>
   <Comp4></Comp4>
</Comp3>

To sent a value from comp1 to comp4 , we need to pass through comp2 and comp3 even though they doesn't need the value. This Situation is called PROP Drilling

To solve Prop Drilling React Suggests a simple way called Context API
How to implement context API?
  1.create a global context to store the value
    To create a global , we use createContext method
  2. create a provide that wraps the context and provides the data to its child components
  3. use the Context using 'useContext' hook

The main advantage of Context API are state management and PROP Drilling can be solved

state management: it is dynamic managaging of all the stated existed in our application
