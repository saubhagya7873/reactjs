what is API?
      Application Programming Interface. it is used to connect othre Applications such as third oarty services or backend of our application

      To get the data from Api, we use fetch or axios
      fetch(url) will return a promise
      we can solve promise using then and catch

      fetch is default browser method and axios is a 3rd party library

      Every Asynchronous function will return a promise

//REST API -- REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER

useEffect is a hook equivalent to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
useEffect is used to handle side effects(changes in the DOM/dynamic value from an API)
useEffect(callback fn,[dependencies array])
There are three possibilities
 1. if there is no dependencies array, then callback fn will run on every state changes
2. if empty dependencies are there , then callback fn will run on only one time
3. if dependencies are mentioned, then callback fn will run only for that dependencies
