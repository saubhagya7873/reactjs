components can send data  from parent component to child component called props. props are the short form of properties
child component receives props as a object in parameters

parent component creates a function and send it to child component  and child component adds/modify a value and retuns to parent component

props can have code / data inside elements content
This is called props children

There is a probelm dealing with props called "PROP DRILLING"
Prop drilling means passing data from parent to child in deep nested.even though  components in middle doesn't use them but stillneeded to be paased

You can solve this using context API

state: state is the dynamic value that is changed and everytime a state changes , component re-renders such that only the elements that got changed will be updated
state is a object.
In functional components, we can get state using useState
useState returns an array of value and method to updated
state method is asynchronous method
